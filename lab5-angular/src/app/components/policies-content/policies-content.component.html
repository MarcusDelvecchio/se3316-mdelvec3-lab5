<ng-container *ngIf="showDCMA">
    <div>
        <br>
        <p>If you believe your content has been taken down in error, or wish to contest a DMCA notice, you can submit a counter-notice to the service provider.  A successful counter-notification will typically remove any "strikes" against your account relating to the particular notice. A counter-notification must include:</p>

        <p>(A) your physical or electronic signature;</p>

        <p>(B) an identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</p>

        <p>(C) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</p>

        <p>(D) your name, address, and telephone number; and</p>

        <p>(E) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you reside, or if you live outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Twitch may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the organization or an agent of the organization.</p>

        <p>
        Unless the copyright holder files a copyright infringement lawsuit against you after receiving your counter-notice, your content will typically be restored to the platform. If the copyright holder does file a lawsuit against you, expect the content to remain offline until the lawsuit is resolved.<br>

        Repeat Infringement
        As part of the DMCA, companies are required to implement a repeat infringer policy. If your account is subject to multiple successful claims, you can expect that account to be terminated.
